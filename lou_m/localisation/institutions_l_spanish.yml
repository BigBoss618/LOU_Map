 desc_feudalism: "The Dragons have returned to the far north, and have begun afflicting the dwarves, and in T.A. 2570 the Dragons made war on the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains in the Ered Mithrin, sacking and plundering their halls and mines."
 desc_renaissance: "In TA 2770, Smaug came from the mountains in the north, drawn by great wealth amassed by the Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain. For two centuries, Smaug ruled the Lonely Mountain uncontested, lying within the great treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain and ensuring that no one entered the mountain in an attempt to steal from him. The surrounding domain became a scarred wasteland known to the Dwarves and men as the Desolation of Smaug."
 desc_new_world_i: "In T.A. 2770 Erebor was sacked by the Dragon Smaug. Many of the Dwarves of Durin's Folk were rendered homeless and wandered through western Middle-earth, trying to make as best a living they could. After some years of wandering they settled down in Dunland. Among these Dwarves were Thrór, formerly the King under the Mountain now King of Durin's folk in exile, his son Thráin II and grandson Thorin II who became later known as Thorin Oakenshield."
 desc_printing_press: "The White Council long feared the power in Dol Guldur might be Sauron, but Saruman opposed assaulting it. However, Gandalf later went to Dol Guldur himself and discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. He then informed the White Council, and Saruman was unable to protest. The White Council attacked Dol Guldur, and Sauron, not yet powerful enough to challenge them, fled to Mordor. Sauron continued to increase his power over the next 100 years in his search for the One Ring."
 desc_global_trade: "In TA 2885 Umbar supported the Haradrim who claimed Harondor, although this had long been a debatable land between the Corsairs and the Kings"
 desc_manufactories: "The War of the Ring was the great conflict at the end of the Third Age, named for the One Ring and the importance this had in the final outcome. The war was fought between Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor who attempted to conquer Middle-earth as he nearly did in the Second Age; and the Free peoples, being a loose alliance of Elves and Men led by the Wise."
 desc_enlightenment: "The Fourth Age began after Sauron was vanquished and his One Ring was destroyed. The Shire and the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were restored. It marked the ascent of Men and the final diminishing of the Elves. Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo and Frodo sailed for the Undying Lands. The allies of Sauron suffered a devastating blow that would take them centuries to recover, if they did at all. Harad was defeated and concluded a peace with King Aragorn II Elessar, by which Umbar, whose fleet had been completely destroyed in the mouths of the Anduin, was returned to Gondor, and South Gondor also annexed."
